A third year at Berkeley, I’m enjoying double majoring in Molecular and Cell Biology and English with minors in music, sleep deprivation, and caffeine metabolism.  In a typical day, you might find me studying lung cancer in my research lab, reading Greek tragedies in the library, or playing bassoon with the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra.  Think my schedule sounds a little crazy? I’ll be honest: I have escaped from Alcatraz (I’m a swimmer too!)  Before I graduate, my goal is to “borrow” the T-rex from the Valley Life Science Building as an attractive coat hanger for my dorm room.  All kidding aside, I’m happy to talk to all of you about Berkeley, and look forward to seeing you at ROHP!</p></td>

I am a third year Molecular and Cell Biology major and Global Poverty and Practice minor who enjoys trying new things but never getting good at any of them. This includes learning the bass guitar, playing GTA IV, and swing dancing. Outside of embarrassing myself, I’m involved in the Suitcase Clinic, MCBcDNA, and <i>C. elegans</i> research. I know all about being pre-med at Berkeley, RCSA, and the Backstreet Boys, so come to ROHP and find out why Berkeley is the place for you!</p></td>

When I'm not studying, hanging out, coding, or drinking boba (which is almost always), you can catch me figure skating for Cal or running half marathons. I also am deeply involved in research, and would be happy to share my experiences. Lastly, as an engineer, I barely get any sleep, and I like it that way! I can answer any questions you have about Berkeley Engineering, or life at Berkeley itself. GO BEARS!</p></td>

I also enjoy reading historical fiction and watching <i>Friends</i> with my dog. Since coming to Berkeley I have gotten involved with Greek life, Bears for Elder Welfare, and Intervarsity Christian Fellowship as well as a few undergraduate research apprenticeship projects. I always make time on weekends to explore around the bay area's great running trails and food places (something I highly recommend). GO BEARS!!!</p></td>

Sharing the campus with awesome students like yourselves is one of the best perks of being a Cal Bear. On campus, I'm involved with a student-run nonprofit, EthiCAL Apparel, CalTV and Cal's American Advertising Federation case competition team. Other times, you can find me binging on documentaries, exploring Berkeley's restaurant scene with foodie friends or chasing down llamas whenever they venture through People's Park. I love meeting new people and sharing lame jokes and puns, so if you're a fan of any of these, come say hi and I'm sure we will be wonderful friends. Go Bears!</p></td>

I’m a first-year Public Health major with the plan of volunteering with the Peace Corps once I graduate. I absolutely love the performing arts, tutoring local Berkeley middle school students through SquashDrive, and anything related to chocolate. One of my favorite aspects of attending Berkeley is talking with current and prospective students, so when you see me at ROHP or on-campus, don’t hesitate to say hello and ask any questions you may have about our fantastic school!</p></td>

I was born in Hong Kong but grew up in Fremont, California so I'm a NorCal girl at heart! Outside of RCSA, I'm pursuing my passion in student government and leadership as an ASUC intern for a senator. I also love exploring everything that Berkeley has to offer, from the breathtaking view at the top of the Campanile to the delicious food around campus. I also love cats, spending time with friends and family, and going on adventures. My favorite thing about Berkeley is how I get to meet so many talented and amazing people who never cease to inspire me.

I was born and raised in Chula Vista, which is a city in the South Bay of San Diego, so you could say that Berkeley is a bit of a change for me. I'm really passionate about anti-human trafficking work, and the goal right now is to try to find a vocation in that field. I have a slight obsession with Disney movies and the Harry Potter series. I like long walks on the beach, candle lit dinners, and colorful sunsets. And, most importantly, I am incredibly, absolutely, positively, supercalifragilisticexpialidociously excited to be on the 2014-2015 ROHP Committee!</p></td>
